A population might enhance its fitness by allowing individual cells to stochastically transition among multiple phenotypes, thus ensuring that some cells are always prepared for an unforeseen environmental fluctuation. Here we experimentally explore how switching affects population growth by using the galactose utilization network of Saccharomyces cerevisiae. We engineered a strain that randomly transitions between two phenotypes as a result of stochastic gene expression5,6,7,8,9. Each phenotype was designed to confer a growth advantage over the other phenotype in a certain environment. When we compared the growth of two populations with different switching rates, we found that fast-switching populations outgrow slow switchers when the environment fluctuates rapidly, whereas slow-switching phenotypes outgrow fast switchers when the environment changes rarely. These results suggest that cells may tune inter-phenotype switching rates to the frequency of environmental changes.},

While live-imaging tools have been used extensively to quantitatively capture rapid transcriptional dynamics in living animal cells, lack of implementation of these technologies in plants has limited concomitant quantitative studies. Here, we applied the PP7 and MS2 RNA-labeling technologies for the quantitative imaging of RNA polymerase II activity dynamics in single cells of living plants as they respond to experimental treatments. Using this technology, we count nascent RNA transcripts in real-time in \emph{Nicotiana benthamiana} (tobacco) and \emph{Arabidopsis thaliana} (Arabidopsis). Examination of heat shock reporters revealed that plant tissues respond to external signals by modulating the number of cells engaged in transcription rather than the transcription rate of active cells. This switch-like behavior, combined with cell-to-cell variability in transcription rate, results in mRNA production variability spanning three orders of magnitude. We determined that cellular heterogeneity stems mainly from the stochasticity intrinsic to individual alleles. Taken together, our results demonstrate that it is now possible to quantitatively study the dynamics of transcriptional programs in single cells of living plants.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

  abstract = {The RNA polymerase sigma factor sigma B is a stress-response regulatory protein in Bacillus subtilis. The activity of sigma B is controlled in part by RsbW, a protein that inhibits sigma B, and RsbV, a protein that counteracts this inhibition. We now demonstrate that purified RsbW is capable of forming alternative complexes with either sigma B or RsbV. Sigma B in the RsbW. sigma B complex was transcriptionally inactive. RsbV reversed this inhibition by sequestering RsbW in a RsbW-RsbV complex, thereby allowing sigma B to remain free and active. In contrast to interactions among the components of the homologous regulatory system for the sporulation transcription factor sigma F, the binding of RsbW to RsbV and sigma B did not require adenosine nucleotides. Experiments involving the exchange of proteins between the two regulatory systems demonstrated that RsbW and its homolog in the sigma F system, SpoIIAB, exhibit strong preference in binding to RsbV and sigma B, and SpoIIAA and sigma F, respectively, and that the difference in nucleotide-dependence of binding between these two systems is attributable to a difference between RsbW and SpoIIAB. In confirmation and extension of previous results, we show that RsbW is also a protein kinase that uses ATP to phosphorylate RsbV, thereby blocking the capacity of RsbV to bind to RsbW and activate transcription. A close correlation was observed between the concentration of ATP required for efficient RsbW-mediated phosphorylation of RsbV, inhibition of RsbW.RsbV comlex formation, and inhibition of sigma B-directed transcription. These results are consistent with the hypothesis that activation of sigma B under certain stress condition is due to a decrease in cellular ATP levels.},

These occur as transient changes in, for example, transcription, translation, and RNA and protein degradation. The intensity and duration of these perturbations differ between cells in a population. The unique state of cells, and thus the diversity in a population, is owing to the different environmental stimuli the individual cells experience and the inherent stochastic nature of biochemical processes (for example, refs 5 and 6). It has been proposed, but not demonstrated, that autoregulatory, negative feedback loops in gene circuits provide stability, thereby limiting the range over which the concentrations of network components fluctuate. Here we have designed and constructed simple gene circuits consisting of a regulator and transcriptional repressor modules in Escherichia coli and we show the gain of stability produced by negative feedback.},

To study the role of sigma 37 in B. subtilis gene expression, we have cloned the gene for this minor species of sigma factor in Escherichia coli by using as a hybridization probe a synthetic oligonucleotide that was designed on the basis of the NH2-terminal amino acid sequence of sigma 37 protein. We determined the nucleotide sequence of the entire sigma 37 gene, which was found to encode a 262-amino acid residue polypeptide of 29.9 kDa. The predicted amino acid sequence of sigma 37 showed significant homology to that of other sigma proteins in a region that has been proposed to be the site of binding of these factors to core RNA polymerase. Genetic mapping experiments placed the gene for sigma 37, herein designated sigB, at 40 degrees on the genetic map of Piggot and Hoch [Piggot, P. \& Hoch, J. A. (1985) Microbiol. Rev. 49, 158-179].

This general stress regulon provides nongrowing and nonsporulated cells with a multiple, nonspecific, and preemptive stress resistance. By a proteome approach we have detected the expression of the SigB regulon during continuous growth at low temperature (15 degrees C). Using a combination of Western blot analysis and SigB-dependent reporter gene fusions, we provide evidence for high-level and persistent induction of the sigB operon and the SigB regulon, respectively, in cells continuously exposed to low temperatures. In contrast to all SigB-activating stimuli described thus far, induction by low temperatures does not depend on the positive regulatory protein RsbV or its regulatory phosphatases RsbU and RsbP, indicating the presence of an entirely new pathway for the activation of SigB by chill stress in B. subtilis. The physiological importance of the induction of the general stress response for the adaptation of B. subtilis to low temperatures is emphasized by the observation that growth of a sigB mutant is drastically impaired at 15 degrees C. Inclusion of the compatible solute glycine betaine in the growth medium not only improved the growth of the wild-type strain but rescued the growth defect of the sigB mutant, indicating that the induction of the general stress regulon and the accumulation of glycine betaine are independent means by which B. subtilis cells cope with chill stress.},

Protein sequestration, where an active protein is bound in an inactive complex by an inhibitor, can potentially generate ultrasensitivity. Here, in a synthetic genetic circuit in budding yeast, we show that sequestration of a basic leucine zipper transcription factor by a dominant-negative inhibitor converts a graded transcriptional response into a sharply ultrasensitive response, with apparent Hill coefficients up to 12. A simple quantitative model for this genetic network shows that both the threshold and the degree of ultrasensitivity depend upon the abundance of the inhibitor, exactly as we observed experimentally. The abundance of the inhibitor can be altered by simple mutation; thus, ultrasensitive responses mediated by protein sequestration are easily tuneable. Gene duplication of regulatory homodimers and loss-of-function mutations can create dominant negatives that sequester and inactivate the original regulator. The generation of flexible ultrasensitive responses is an unappreciated adaptive advantage that could explain the frequent evolutionary emergence of dominant negatives.},

The gram-positive bacterium Bacillus subtilis responds to energy stress (ATP depletion) and to environmental stressors using two distinct stress-sensing pathways that converge on the alternative sigma factor {$\sigma$}B to provoke a general stress response. Past efforts to study the {$\sigma$}B stress response in bulk culture and on agarose pads were unable to visualize the responses of individual cells under tightly controlled conditions for extended periods of time. Here we use a microfluidics-based strategy to discern the basic features of {$\sigma$}B activation in single cells in response to energy and environmental stress, both immediately upon stressor exposure and for tens of generations thereafter. Upon energy stress at various levels of stressor, cells exhibited fast, transient, and amplitude-modulated responses but not frequency modulation as previously reported. Upon environmental stress, which is mediated by the stressosome complex, wild-type cells primarily exhibited a transient and amplitude-modulated response. However, mutant cells producing only one of the four paralogous RsbR stressosome proteins showed striking and previously unseen differences. Whereas RsbRA-only cells mimicked the wild type, RsbRC-only cells displayed a slower but sustained overall response composed of repeated activation events in single cells.},

Therefore, there is a critical need from genetic engineers for scalable strategies that yield custom bistable switches. Here, we use a sigma factor and its cognate anti-sigma factor to experimentally verify that ultrasensitivity from sequestration combined with positive feedback is sufficient to build a bistable switch. We show that sequestration allows us to predictably tune the switching boundaries, and we can easily tune our switch to function as a set?reset latch that can be toggled between two states by a pulse of inducer input.},

Expression of periplasmic chaperones and folding catalysts is under the control of {$\varsigma$}E RNA polymerase. The N-terminal domain of RseA sequesters {$\varsigma$}E in the cytoplasmic membrane, preventing its association with core RNA polymerase. The C-terminal domain of RseA interacts with RseB, a periplasmic protein. The relative concentration of {$\varsigma$}E:RseA:RseB is 2:5:1 and this ratio remains unaltered upon heat shock induction of the {$\varsigma$}E regulon.

RseB binding to the C-terminal domain of RseA increases the affinity of RseA for {$\varsigma$}E by 2- to 3-fold (K d 50\textendash 100 nm). RseB binds also to the misfolded aggregates of MalE31, a variant of maltose binding protein that forms inclusion bodies in the periplasm. We discuss a model whereby the RseB-RseA interaction represents a measure for misfolded polypeptides in the bacterial envelope, modulating the assembly of {$\varsigma$}E RNA polymerase and the cellular heat shock response.},

However, the underlying mechanisms involved in patterning the cleavage-stage embryo are still unresolved. By analyzing the distribution of the transcription factors Oct4 (Pou5f1), Cdx2 and Nanog at precisely defined stages in pre-implantation development, we were able to identify critical events leading to the divergence of TE, EPI and PE lineages. We found that Oct4 is present in all cells until late blastocyst, gradually disappearing from the TE thereafter. The expression patterns of both Cdx2 and Nanog exhibit two specific phases, culminating in their restriction to TE and EPI, respectively. In the first phase, starting after compaction, blastomeres show highly variable Cdx2 and Nanog protein levels. Importantly, the variability in Nanog levels is independent of position within the morula, whereas Cdx2 variability may originate from asymmetric cell divisions at the 8-cell stage in a non-stereotypic way. Furthermore, there is initially no reciprocal relationship between Cdx2 and Oct4 or between Cdx2 and Nanog protein levels. In the second phase, a definite pattern is established, possibly by a sorting process that accommodates intrinsic and extrinsic cues. Based on these results, we propose a model in which early embryonic mouse patterning includes stochastic processes, consistent with the highly regulative capacity of the embryo. This may represent a feature unique to early mammalian development.},

  abstract = {The activity of sigma B, a secondary sigma factor of Bacillus subtilis, is primarily controlled by an anti-sigma factor protein (RsbW) that binds to sigma B and blocks its ability to form an RNA polymerase holoenzyme (E-sigma B). Inhibition of sigma B by RsbW is counteracted by RsbV, a protein that is essential for the activation of sigma B-dependent transcription. When crude B. subtilis extracts were fractionated by gel filtration chromatography or electrophoresis through nondenaturing polyacrylamide gels, a complex composed of RsbW and RsbV that is distinct from the previously observed RsbW-sigma B complex was detected. In analogous experiments, RsbX, an additional regulator of sigma B-dependent transcription that is thought to act independently of RsbV-RsbW, was not found to associate with any of the other sigB operon products. Two forms of RsbV were visualized when crude cell extracts of B. subtilis were subjected to isoelectric focusing (IEF), with the more negatively charged RsbV species absent from extracts prepared from RsbW- strains. In vitro, RsbV became phosphorylated when incubated with ATP and RsbW but not with ATP alone. The phosphorylated RsbV species comigrated during IEF with the RsbW-dependent form of RsbV found in crude cell extracts. These results suggest that the modified RsbV, present in crude cell extracts, is phosphorylated. When gel filtration fractions containing RsbV-RsbW complexes or RsbV alone were subjected to IEF, only the unmodified form of RsbV was found associated with RsbW. The presumed phosphorylated variant of RsbV was present only in fractions that did not contain RsbW. The data support a model whereby RsbV binds directly to RsbW and blocks its ability to form the RsbW-sigma B complex. This activity of RsbV appears to be inhibited by RsbW-dependent phosphorylation.},

The environmental branch of this pathway contains a family of five paralogous proteins that function as negative regulators. Here we present genetic evidence that a sixth paralog, YtvA, acts as a positive regulator in the same environmental signaling branch. We also present biochemical evidence that YtvA and at least three of the negative regulators can be isolated from cell extracts in a large environmental signaling complex. YtvA differs from these associated negative regulators by its flavin mononucleotide (FMN)-containing light-oxygen-voltage domain. Others have shown that this domain has the photochemistry expected for a blue-light sensor, with the covalent linkage of the FMN chromophore to cysteine 62 composing a critical part of the photocycle. Consistent with the view that light intensity modifies the output of the environmental signaling pathway, we found that cysteine 62 is required for YtvA to exert its positive regulatory role in the absence of other stress. Transcriptional analysis of the ytvA structural gene indicated that it provides the entry point for at least one additional environmental input, mediated by the Spx global regulator of disulfide stress. These results support a model in which the large signaling complex serves to integrate multiple environmental signals in order to modulate the general stress response.},

Various environmental cues help in the maturation of core RNA polymerase (RNAP; {$\alpha$}2{$\beta\beta{'}\omega$}) with different {$\sigma$}-factors, leading to the directed recruitment of RNAP to different promoter DNA sequences. Thus it is essential to determine the {$\sigma$}-factors that affect the preferential partitioning of core RNAP among various {$\sigma$}-actors, and the role of {$\sigma$}-switching in transcriptional gene regulation. Further, the macromolecular assembly of holo RNAP takes place in an extremely crowded environment within a cell, and thus far the kinetics and thermodynamics of this molecular recognition process have not been well addressed. In this study we used a site-directed bioaffinity immobilization method to evaluate the relative binding affinities of three different Escherichia coli {$\sigma$}-factors to the same core RNAP with variations in temperature and ionic strength while emulating the crowded cellular milieu. Our data indicate that the interaction of core RNAP-{$\sigma$} is susceptible to changes in external stimuli such as osmolytic and thermal stress, and the degree of susceptibility varies among different {$\sigma$}-factors. This allows for a reversible {$\sigma$}-switching from housekeeping factors to alternate {$\sigma$}-factors when the organism senses a change in its physiological conditions.},

  abstract = {The study of protein-protein interactions is becoming increasingly important for understanding the regulation of many cellular processes. The ability to quantify the strength with which two binding partners interact is desirable but the accurate determination of equilibrium binding constants is a difficult process. The use of Luminescence Resonance Energy Transfer (LRET) provides a homogeneous binding assay that can be used for the detection of protein-protein interactions. Previously, we developed an LRET assay to screen for small molecule inhibitors of the interaction of {$\sigma$}70 with the{$\beta$}' coiled-coil fragment (amino acids 100\textendash 309). Here we describe an LRET binding assay used to monitor the interaction of E. coli {$\sigma$}70 and {$\sigma$}32 with core RNA polymerase along with the controls to verify the system. This approach generates fluorescently labeled proteins through the random labeling of lysine residues which enables the use of the LRET assay for proteins for which the creation of single cysteine mutants is not feasible. With the LRET binding assay, we are able to show that the interaction of {$\sigma$}70 with core RNAP is much more sensitive to NaCl than to potassium glutamate (KGlu), whereas the {$\sigma$}32 interaction with core RNAP is insensitive to both salts even at concentrations {$>$}500 mM. We also find that the interaction of {$\sigma$}32 with core RNAP is stronger than {$\sigma$}70 with core RNAP, under all conditions tested. This work establishes a consistent set of conditions for the comparison of the binding affinities of the E.coli sigma factors with core RNA polymerase. The examination of the importance of salt conditions in the binding of these proteins could have implications in both in vitro assay conditions and in vivo function.},

In addition, the model predicted that {$\sigma$}s compete for binding to E only when their total number exceeds the total amount of RNA polymerase (excluding that involved in elongation) and that weak promoters will be preferentially subjected to {$\sigma$} competition.},

Such genetic regulation usually consists of interacting networks, whereby gene products from a single network can act to control their own expression or the production of protein in another network. Engineered control of cellular function through the design and manipulation of such networks lies within the constraints of current technology. Here we develop a model describing the regulation of gene expression and elucidate the effects of noise on the formulation. We consider a single network derived from bacteriophage {$\lambda$} and construct a two-parameter deterministic model describing the temporal evolution of the concentration of {$\lambda$} repressor protein. Bistability in the steady-state protein concentration arises naturally, and we show how the bistable regime is enhanced with the addition of the first operator site in the promotor region. We then show how additive and multiplicative external noise can be used to regulate expression. In the additive case, we demonstrate the utility of such control through the construction of a protein switch, whereby protein production is turned ``on'' and ``off'' by using short noise pulses. In the multiplicative case, we show that small deviations in the transcription rate can lead to large fluctuations in the production of protein, and we describe how these fluctuations can be used to amplify protein production significantly. These results suggest that an external noise source could be used as a switch and/or amplifier for gene expression. Such a development could have important implications for gene therapy.},

The SigB-dependent response is conserved in related gram-positive bacteria but is missing in strictly anaerobic or in some facultatively anaerobic gram-positive bacteria. It covers functions from nonspecific and multiple stress resistance to the control of virulence in pathogenic bacteria. A comprehensive understanding of this crucial stress response is essential not only for bacterial physiology but also for applied microbiology, including pathogenicity and pathogen control.},

  abstract = {In Bacillus subtilis, the major sigma factor, sigma-A (rpoD), and the minor sigma factor, sigma-H (spo0H), are present during growth and are required for the initiation of sporulation. Our experiments indicate that sigma-A and sigma-H compete for binding to core RNA polymerase. We used a fusion of rpoD to the Lacl-repressible IPTG-inducible promoter, Pspac, to vary the levels of sigma-A in the cell. Increasing the amount of sigma-A caused a decrease in expression of genes controlled by sigma-H, and a delay in the production of heat-resistant spores. Decreasing the amount of sigma-A, in a strain deleted for the chromosomal rpoD, caused an increase in expression of genes controlled by sigma-H. As rpoD itself is controlled by at least two promoters recognized by RNA polymerase that contains sigma-H, the effect of sigma-A levels on expression of sigma-H-controlled promoters represents a feedback mechanism that might contribute to maintaining appropriate levels of sigma-A. While the level of sigma-A was important for efficient sporulation, our results indicate that the normal transcriptional control of rpoD, in the context of the rpoD operon and the numerous promoters in that operon, is not required for efficient sporulation or germination, provided that the sigma-A level from a heterologous promoter is comparable to that in wild-type cells.},

  abstract = {The cell division cycle is the process by which eukaryotic cells replicate their chromosomes and partition them to two daughter cells. To maintain the integrity of the genome, proliferating cells must be able to block progression through the division cycle at key transition points (called ``checkpoints'') if there have been problems in the replication of the chromosomes or their biorientation on the mitotic spindle. These checkpoints are governed by protein-interaction networks, composed of phase-specific cell-cycle activators and inhibitors. Examples include Cdk1:Clb5 and its inhibitor Sic1 at the G1/S checkpoint in budding yeast, APC:Cdc20 and its inhibitor MCC at the mitotic checkpoint, and PP2A:B55 and its inhibitor, alpha-endosulfine, at the mitotic-exit checkpoint. Each of these inhibitors is a substrate as well as a stoichiometric inhibitor of the cell-cycle activator. Because the production of each inhibitor is promoted by a regulatory protein that is itself inhibited by the cell-cycle activator, their interaction network presents a regulatory motif characteristic of a ``feedback-amplified domineering substrate'' (FADS). We describe how the FADS motif responds to signals in the manner of a bistable toggle switch, and then we discuss how this toggle switch accounts for the abrupt and irreversible nature of three specific cell-cycle checkpoints.},

Flagellar gene expression is extensively regulated to coordinate flagellar assembly in both space and time.

Here we determine that in the absence of SwrA and SwrB, the phosphorylated form of the response regulator DegU inhibits {$\sigma$}D-dependent gene expression indirectly by binding to the PflgM promoter region and activating expression of the anti-sigma factor FlgM. We further demonstrate that DegU-P-dependent activation of FlgM is essential to inhibit flagellin expression when flagellar basal body assembly is disrupted. Regulation of FlgM is poorly understood outside of Salmonella, and differential control of FlgM expression may be a common means of coupling flagellin expression to flagellar assembly.},

We have investigated the expression and regulation of the ECF {$\varsigma$} factor encoded by the sigW gene. A {$\varsigma$}W-dependent promoter (PW) precedes sigW, demonstrating that this transcription factor is positively autoregulated. Expression of sigW is regulated by both growth phase and medium composition. Maximal expression is attained in early-stationary-phase cells grown in rich medium. We previously reported that sigW mutants have elevated transcription of some {$\varsigma$}X-controlled genes, and we now report that the converse is also true: in a sigX mutant, PW is derepressed during logarithmic growth. Thus, these two regulons are mutually antagonistic. Reconstituted {$\varsigma$}W holoenzyme faithfully recognizes the PW preceding sigW but does not recognize the PX promoter preceding the sigX gene. Autoregulation of sigX is also highly specific: {$\varsigma$}X holoenzyme initiates transcription from PX but recognizes PW poorly if at all. In contrast, several promoters that are at least partially under {$\varsigma$}X control are active with both the {$\varsigma$}X and {$\varsigma$}W holoenzymes in vitro. This finding supports the suggestion that the {$\varsigma$}W and {$\varsigma$}X regulons overlap. Sequence comparisons suggest that promoters recognized by these two {$\varsigma$} factors have similar -35 elements but are distinguished by different base preferences at two key positions within the -10 element.},

The adenosine triphosphatase (ATPase) activity of KaiC is the source of the 24-h period and temperature compensation. Although numerous circadian mutants of KaiC have been identified, the tuning mechanism of the 24-h period remains unclear. Here, we show that the circadian period of in vitro phosphorylation rhythm of mutants at position 402 of KaiC changed dramatically, from 15 h (0.6 d) to 158 h (6.6 d). The ATPase activities of mutants at position 402 of KaiC, without KaiA and KaiB, correlated with the frequencies (1/period), indicating that KaiC structure was the source of extra period change. Despite the wide-range tunability, temperature compensation of both the circadian period and the KaiC ATPase activity of mutants at position 402 of KaiC were nearly intact. We also found that in vivo and in vitro circadian periods and the KaiC ATPase activity of mutants at position 402 of KaiC showed a correlation with the side-chain volume of the amino acid at position 402 of KaiC. Our results indicate that residue 402 is a key position of determining the circadian period of cyanobacteria, and it is possible to dramatically alter the period of KaiC while maintaining temperature compensation.},

  abstract = {Bacillus subtilis sigma-B is an alternate sigma factor implicated in controlling stationary-phase gene expression. We characterized the genetic organization and regulation of the region containing the sigma-B structural gene (sigB) to learn which metabolic signals and protein factors govern sigma-B function. sigB lay in an operon with four open reading frames (orfs) in the order orfV-orfW-sigB-orfX, and lacZ gene fusions showed that all four frames were translated in vivo. Experiments with primer extension, S1 nuclease mapping, and lacZ transcriptional fusions found that sigB operon transcription initiated early in stationary phase from a site 32 nucleotides upstream of orfV and terminated 34 nucleotides downstream of orfX. Fusion expression was abolished in a strain carrying an in-frame deletion in sigB, suggesting that sigma-B positively regulated its own synthesis, and deletions in the sigB promoter region showed that sequences identical to the sigma-B-dependent ctc promoter were essential for promoter activity. Fusion expression was greatly enhanced in a strain carrying an insertion mutation in orfX, suggesting that the 22-kilodalton (kDa) orfX product was a negative effector of sigma-B expression or activity. Notably, the genetic organization of the sigB operon was strikingly similar to that of the B. subtilis spoIIA operon, which has the gene order spoIIAA-spoIIAB-spoIIAC, with spoIIAC encoding the sporulation-essential sigma-F. The predicted sequence of the 12-kDa orfV product was 32\% identical to that of the 13-kDa SpoIIAA protein, and the 18-kDa orfW product was 27\% identical to the 16-kDa SpoIIAB protein. On the basis of this clear evolutionary conservation, we speculate these protein pairs regulate their respective sigma factors by a similar molecular mechanism and that the spoIIA and sigB operons might control divergent branches of stationary-phase gene expression.},

  abstract = {Activity of the general stress transcription factor {$\sigma$}B of Bacillus subtilis is regulated directly by a partner-switching mechanism in which key protein interactions are governed by serine phosphorylation. Signals of energy or environmental stress are conveyed to {$\sigma$}B by independent pathways, each terminating with a differentially regulated serine phosphatase, whose activity is required to control the partner-switching regulators. We present genetic and biochemical evidence that activation of the RsbU environmental signaling phosphatase is modulated by a second, atypical partner switch that comprises redundant negative regulatory proteins in a large, multicomponent signaling complex. In the current model, negative regulation of the RsbU phosphatase depends solely on the RsbS antagonist protein. Here, we perform a critical genetic test that invalidates this model and demonstrates that the RsbS antagonist alone is insufficient to prevent environmental signaling. Also required is one of a family of four co-antagonist proteins, here renamed RsbRA, RsbRB, RsbRC, and RsbRD, each with a carboxyl-terminal domain closely resembling the entire RsbS protein. Because any single member of the RsbR family, together with RsbS, was sufficient for environmental signaling, we conclude that the RsbR proteins serve as redundant co-antagonists necessary for RsbS antagonist function. Moreover, purification of RsbRA from cell extracts by nickel affinity and gel-filtration chromatography found a multicomponent complex containing the RsbRA and RsbRB co-antagonists together with the RsbS antagonist. We propose that this complex serves as a machine to transmit stress signals to {$\sigma$}B, and that the properties of the complex may contribute to environmental stress sensing.},

Both sigmaF and sigma70 (the major sigma subunit in growing cells) were overexpressed, purified to homogeneity, and compared with respect to activity and specificity. The affinity of sigmaF to core RNA polymerase (E) is higher than that of sigma70, as measured by gel filtration high-pressure liquid chromatography. In an in vitro transcription system, the holoenzyme (E sigmaF) containing sigmaF selectively transcribed the flagellar and chemotaxis genes, all of which could not be transcribed by E sigma70. This strict promoter recognition property of sigmaF is similar to those of other stress response minor sigma subunits but different from those of the principal sigma subunits, sigma70 and sigma38. sigma70-dependent transcription in vitro is inhibited at high concentrations of all salts tested, showing maximum activity at 50 mM. In contrast, sigmaF-dependent transcription was maximum at 50 mM KCI and then decreased to negligible level at 300 mM; in the cases of potassium acetate and potassium glutamate, maximum transcription was between 200 and 300 mM. DNase I foot printing of the fliC and fliD promoters indicated that sigmaF alone is unable to bind DNA, but E sigmaF specifically recognizes -10 and -35 regions of the sigmaF-dependent promoters with rather long upstream protection. Alteration of the promoter structure after binding of E sigmaF was suggested.},

We derive a relation between the long-term growth rate of the organism and the information available about its fluctuating environment. If their environments change rarely, the best strategy for bacteria is to switch phenotypes infrequently; if change is common, it is better to adapt accordingly.

Time-lapse microscopy techniques are beginning to provide a direct view of circuit dynamics in individual living cells. Unexpectedly, we are discovering that key transcription and regulatory factors pulse on and off repeatedly, and often stochastically, even when cells are maintained in constant conditions. This type of spontaneous dynamic behavior is pervasive, appearing in diverse cell types from microbes to mammalian cells. Here, we review recent work showing how pulsing is generated and controlled by underlying regulatory circuits and how it provides critical capabilities to cells in stress response, signaling, and development. A major theme is the ability of pulsing to enable time-based regulation analogous to strategies used in engineered systems. Thus, pulsatile dynamics is emerging as a central, and still largely unexplored, layer of temporal organization in the cell.},

We observed that energy stress activates {$\sigma$}B in discrete stochastic pulses, with increasing levels of stress leading to higher pulse frequencies. By perturbing and rewiring the endogenous system, we found that this behavior results from three key features of the {$\sigma$}B circuit: an ultrasensitive phosphorylation switch; stochasticity (``noise''), which activates that switch; and a mixed (positive and negative) transcriptional feedback, which can both amplify a pulse and switch it off. Together, these results show how prokaryotes encode signals using stochastic pulse frequency modulation through a compact regulatory architecture. Energy stress activates an alternative sigma factor in stochastic pulses and modulates pulse frequency to control activity.

We further address the source of the noise that results in the stochastic selection of cells that will express comK.

In the presence of a fixed amount of {$\sigma$}70, the principal {$\sigma$} for growth-related genes, the level of E{$\sigma$}70 holoenzyme formation increased linearly with the increase in core enzyme level, giving an apparent Kd for the core enzyme of 0.26 nM. Mixed reconstitution experiments in the presence of a fixed amount of core enzyme and increasing amounts of an equimolar mixture of all seven {$\sigma$} subunits indicated that {$\sigma$}70 is strongest in terms of core enzyme binding, followed by {$\sigma$}N, {$\sigma$}F, {$\sigma$}E/{$\sigma$}FecI, {$\sigma$}H and {$\sigma$}S in decreasing order. The orders of core binding affinity between {$\sigma$}70 and {$\sigma$}N and between {$\sigma$}70 and {$\sigma$}H were confirmed by measuring the replacement of one core-associated {$\sigma$} by another {$\sigma$} subunit.

  abstract = {Sigma factors control global switches of the genetic expression program in bacteria. Different sigma factors compete for binding to a limited pool of RNA polymerase (RNAP) core enzymes, providing a mechanism for cross-talk between genes or gene classes via the sharing of expression machinery. To analyze the contribution of sigma factor competition to global changes in gene expression, we develop a theoretical model that describes binding between sigma factors and core RNAP, transcription, non-specific binding to DNA and the modulation of the availability of the molecular components. The model is validated by comparison with in vitro competition experiments, with which excellent agreement is found. Transcription is affected via the modulation of the concentrations of the different types of holoenzymes, so saturated promoters are only weakly affected by sigma factor competition. However, in case of overlapping promoters or promoters recognized by two types of sigma factors, we find that even saturated promoters are strongly affected. Active transcription effectively lowers the affinity between the sigma factor driving it and the core RNAP, resulting in complex cross-talk effects. Sigma factor competition is not strongly affected by non-specific binding of core RNAPs, sigma factors and holoenzymes to DNA. Finally, we analyze the role of increased core RNAP availability upon the shut-down of ribosomal RNA transcription during the stringent response. We find that passive up-regulation of alternative sigma-dependent transcription is not only possible, but also displays hypersensitivity based on the sigma factor competition. Our theoretical analysis thus provides support for a significant role of passive control during that global switch of the gene expression program.},

E. coli possess a very large number of proteolytic enzymes distributed in the cytoplasm, the inner membrane, and the periplasm, but, with few exceptions, the physiological functions of these proteases are not known. More than 90\% of the protein degradation occurring in the cytoplasm is energy-dependent, but the activities of most E. coli proteases in vitro are not energy-dependent. Two ATP-dependent proteases, Lon and Clp, are responsible for 70-80\% of the energy-dependent degradation of proteins in vivo. In vitro studies with Lon and Clp indicate that both proteases directly interact with substrates for degradation. ATP functions as an allosteric effector promoting an active conformation of the proteases, and ATP hydrolysis is required for rapid catalytic turnover of peptide bond cleavage in proteins. Lon and Clp show virtually no homology at the amino acid level, and thus it appears that at least two families of ATP-dependent proteases have evolved independently.},

We now present evidence for the mRNA secondary structure model by means of structure probing of RNA with chemical and enzymatic probes. A similar analysis of several mutant RNAs with a mutation predicted to alter a base pairing or with two compensatory mutations revealed altered secondary structures consistent with the expression and heat inducibility of the corresponding fusion constructs observed in vivo. These findings led us to assess the possible roles of each of the stem-loop structures by analyzing an additional set of deletions and base substitutions. The results indicated not only the primary importance of base pairings between the translation initiation region of ca. 20 nucleotides (the AUG initiation codon plus the ``downstream box'') and the internal region of rpoH mRNA but also the requirement of appropriate stability of mRNA secondary structures for characteristic thermoregulation, i.e., repression at a low temperature and induction upon a temperature upshift.},

Several recent studies have measured variability in protein and messenger RNA levels, and they have discovered strong connections between noise and gene regulation mechanisms. When integrated with discrete stochastic models, measurements of cell-to-cell variability provide a sensitive ``fingerprint'' with which to explore fundamental questions of gene regulation.

  abstract = {Despite the central role of alternative sigma factors in bacterial stress response and virulence their regulation remains incompletely understood. Here we investigate one of the best-studied examples of alternative sigma factors: the {$\sigma$}B network that controls the general stress response of Bacillus subtilis to uncover widely relevant general design principles that describe the structure-function relationship of alternative sigma factor regulatory networks. We show that the relative stoichiometry of the synthesis rates of {$\sigma$}B, its anti-sigma factor RsbW and the anti-anti-sigma factor RsbV plays a critical role in shaping the network behavior by forcing the {$\sigma$}B network to function as an ultrasensitive negative feedback loop. We further demonstrate how this negative feedback regulation insulates alternative sigma factor activity from competition with the housekeeping sigma factor for RNA polymerase and allows multiple stress sigma factors to function simultaneously with little competitive interference.},

  abstract = {Alternative bacterial sigma factors bind the catalytic core RNA polymerase to confer promoter selectivity on the holoenzyme. The different holoenzymes are thus programmed to recognize the distinct promoter classes in the genome to allow coordinated activation of discrete sets of genes needed for adaptive responses. To form the holoenzymes, the different sigma factors must be available to compete for their common substrate (core RNA polymerase). This review highlights (a) the roles of antisigma factors in controlling the availability of alternative sigma factors and (b) the involvement of diverse regulatory molecules that promote the use of alternative sigma factors through subversion of the domineering housekeeping {$\sigma$}70. The latter include the nucleotide alarmone ppGpp and small proteins (DksA, Rsd, and Crl), which directly target the transcriptional machinery to mediate their effects.},

However, it remains unclear how single cells couple gene expression with growth to implement these strategies. Here, we show how noisy expression of a key stress-response regulator, RpoS, allows E. coli to modulate its growth dynamics to survive future adverse environments. We reveal a dynamic positive feedback loop between RpoS and growth rate that produces multi-generation RpoS pulses. We do so experimentally using single-cell, time-lapse microscopy and microfluidics and theoretically with a stochastic model. Next, we demonstrate~that E. coli prepares for sudden stress by entering prolonged periods of slow growth mediated by RpoS. This dynamic phenotype is captured by the RpoS-growth feedback model. Our synthesis of noisy gene expression, growth, and survival paves the way for further exploration of functional phenotypic variability.},

Through extensive use of multiple dispatch, metaprogramming, plot recipes, foreign function interfaces (FFI), and call-overloading, DifferentialEquations.jl offers a unified user interface to solve and analyze various forms of differential equations while not sacrificing features or performance. Many modern features are integrated into the solvers, such as allowing arbitrary user-defined number systems for high-precision and arithmetic with physical units, built-in multithreading and parallelism, and symbolic calculation of Jacobians. Integrated into the package is an algorithm testing and benchmarking suite to both ensure accuracy and serve as an easy way for researchers to develop and distribute their own methods. Together, these features build a highly extendable suite which is feature-rich and highly performant.

This change in RNAP promoter selectivity allows a rapid and flexible reformulation of the genetic program to face environmental and metabolic stimuli that could compromise bacterial fitness. The model bacterium Bacillus subtilis constitutes a matchless living system to study the role of alternative sigma factors in gene regulation and physiology. SigB from B. sultilis was the first alternative sigma factor described in bacteria. Studies of SigB during the last 40 years have shown that it controls a genetic universe of more than 150 genes playing crucial roles in stress response, adaption and survival. Activation of SigB relies on three separate pathways that specifically respond to energy, environmental and low temperature stresses. SigB homologs, present in other Gram-positive bacteria, also play important roles in virulence against mammals. Interestingly, during recent years, others unexpected B. subtilis responses, were found to be controlled by SigB. In particular, SigB controls the efficiencies of spore and biofilm formation, two important features playing critical roles for adaptation and survival in planktonic and sessile B. subtilis communities. In B. subtilis, SigB induces the expression of the Spo0E aspartyl-phosphatase responsible for the blockage of sporulation initiation. The upregulated activity of Spo0E interconnects the two predominant adaptive pathways (i.e., sporulation and stress response) present in B. subtilis. In addition, the RsbP serine-phosphatase, belonging to the energy stress arm of the SigB regulatory cascade, controls the expression of the key transcription factor SinR to decide whether cells residing in the biofilm remain in and mantain biofilm growth or scape to colonize new niches through biofilm dispersal. Finally, SigB intervenes in the recognition and response to surrounding microorganisms, a new SigB role, that could have agronomic impact. SigB is induced when B. subtilis is confronted with phytopathogenic fungi (e.g., Fusarium verticillioides) and halts fungal growth to the benefit of plant growth. In this review, we update the knowledge on the different regulatory networks controlling the activation of SigB and its new roles described during the recent years.},

The activity of the alternative, extracytoplasmic function (ECF) sigma factor {$\sigma$}W is modulated by a specific anti-sigma factor (RsiW or YbbM) encoded by the rsiW (ybbM) gene located immediately downstream of sigW. The RsiW membrane topology was determined, and a specific reporter system for RsiW function was constructed. Experiments using the yeast two-hybrid system suggested a direct interaction of {$\sigma$}W with the cytoplasmic part of RsiW. Analysis of truncated forms of the RsiW protein revealed that {$\sigma$}W induction by alkaline shock is dependent on both the transmembrane and the extracytoplasmic domain of RsiW. Western blot and pulse\textendash chase experiments demonstrated degradation of RsiW after an alkaline shock. A B. subtilis mutant strain deleted for the Escherichia coli yaeL orthologue yluC, encoding a transmembrane protease, was defective in inducing a {$\sigma$}W-controlled promoter after alkaline shock and accumulated a membrane-bound truncated form of RsiW, suggesting that the activity of {$\sigma$}W is controlled by the proteolysis of RsiW by at least two different proteolytic steps.},

  abstract = {Genetically identical individuals in bacterial populations can display significant phenotypic variability. This variability can be functional, for example by allowing a fraction of stress prepared cells to survive an otherwise lethal stress. The optimal fraction of stress prepared cells depends on environmental conditions. However, how bacterial populations modulate their level of phenotypic variability remains unclear. Here we show that the alternative sigma factor {$\sigma$}V circuit in Bacillus subtilis generates functional phenotypic variability that can be tuned by stress level, environmental history and genetic perturbations. Using single-cell time-lapse microscopy and microfluidics, we find the fraction of cells that immediately activate {$\sigma$}V under lysozyme stress depends on stress level and on a transcriptional memory of previous stress. Iteration between model and experiment reveals that this tunability can be explained by the autoregulatory feedback structure of the sigV operon. As predicted by the model, genetic perturbations to the operon also modulate the response variability. The conserved sigma-anti-sigma autoregulation motif is thus a simple mechanism for bacterial populations to modulate their heterogeneity based on their environment.},

The spectroscopic properties of such 7AW proteins allows their absorbance and fluorescence to be monitored selectively, even in the presence of high concentrations of other tryptophan-containing proteins. The 7AWsigma(N) retained its biological activity in stimulating transcription from sigma(N)-specific promoters, and in in vitro gel electrophoresis assays of binding to core RNAP from Escherichia coli. Furthermore, five Trp--{$>$}Ala single mutants of sigma(N) were shown to support growth under conditions of nitrogen limitation, and showed comparable efficiency in activating the sigma(N)-dependent nifH promoter in vivo, indicating that none of the tryptophan residues were essential for activity. The equilibrium binding of 7AWsigma(N) to core RNAP was examined by analytical ultracentrifugation. In sedimentation equilibrium experiments, absorbance data at 315 nm (which reports selectively on the distribution of free and bound 7AWsigma(N)) established that a 1:1 complex was formed, with a dissociation constant lower than 2 microM. The kinetics of the interaction between 7AWsigma(N) and core RNAP was investigated using stopped-flow spectrofluorimetry. A biphasic decrease in fluorescence intensity was observed when samples were excited at 280 nm, whereas only the slower of the two phases was observed at 315 nm. The kinetic data were analysed in terms of a mechanism in which a fast bimolecular association of sigma(N) with core RNAP is followed by a relatively slow isomerization step. The consequences of these findings on the competition between sigma(N) and the major sigma factor, sigma(70), in Escherichia coli are discussed.},

To decipher the sources and consequences of this noise, we systematically measured pairwise correlations between large numbers of genes, including those with high variability. We find that there is substantial pathway variability shared across similarly regulated genes. This induces quantitative correlations in the expression of functionally related genes such as those involved in the Msn2/4 stress response pathway, amino-acid~biosynthesis, and mitochondrial maintenance. Bioinformatic analyses and genetic perturbations suggest that fluctuations in PKA and Tor signaling contribute to pathway-specific variability. Our results argue that a limited number of well-delineated "noise regulons" operate across a yeast cell and that such coordinated fluctuations enable a stochastic but coherent induction of functionally related genes. Finally, we show that pathway noise is a quantitative tool for exploring pathway features and regulatory relationships in un-stimulated systems.},

Using a synthetic system in budding yeast, we show that positive feedback involving a promoter with multiple transcription factor (TF) binding sites can induce a steady-state bimodal response without cooperative binding of the TF. Deterministic models of this system do not predict bistability. Rather, the bimodal response requires a short-lived TF and stochastic fluctuations in the TF's expression. Multiple binding sites provide these fluctuations. Because many promoters possess multiple binding sites and many TFs are unstable, positive-feedback loops in gene regulatory networks may exhibit bimodal responses, but not necessarily because of deterministic bistability, as is commonly thought. Noise induced by multiple binding sites, rather than deterministic bistability, may cause bimodal gene expression in yeast.

  abstract = {In bacteria, transcriptional regulation is a key step in cellular gene expression. All bacteria contain a core RNA polymerase that is catalytically competent but requires an additional {$\sigma$} factor for specific promoter recognition and correct transcriptional initiation. The RNAP core is not able to selectively bind to a given {$\sigma$} factor. In contrast, different {$\sigma$} factors have different affinities for the RNAP core. As a consequence, the concentration of alternate {$\sigma$} factors requires strict regulation in order to properly control the delicate interplay among them, which favors the competence for the RNAP core. This control is archived by different {$\sigma$}/anti-{$\sigma$} controlling mechanisms that shape complex regulatory networks and cascades, and enable the response to sudden environmental cues, whose global understanding is a current challenge for systems biology. Although there have been a number of excellent studies on each of these {$\sigma$}/anti-{$\sigma$} post-transcriptional regulatory systems, no comprehensive comparison of these mechanisms in a single model organism has been conducted. Here, we survey all these systems in E. coli dissecting and analyzing their inner workings and highlightin their differences. Then, following an integral approach, we identify their commonalities and outline some of the principles exploited by the cell to effectively and globally reprogram the transcriptional machinery. These principles provide guidelines for developing biological synthetic circuits enabling an efficient and robust response to sudden stimuli.},

The functional roles of noise in biological processes can vary greatly. Along with standard, entropy-increasing effects of producing random mutations, diversifying phenotypes in isogenic populations, limiting information capacity of signaling relays, it occasionally plays more surprising constructive roles by accelerating the pace of evolution, providing selective advantage in dynamic environments, enhancing intracellular transport of biomolecules and increasing information capacity of signaling pathways. This short review covers the recent progress in understanding mechanisms and effects of fluctuations in biological systems of different scales and the basic approaches to their mathematical modeling.},

  abstract = {sigma B is a secondary sigma factor that controls the general stress response of Bacillus subtilis. sigma B-dependent transcription is induced by the activation of sigma B itself, a process that involves release of sigma B from an inhibitory complex with its primary regulator, RsbW. sigma B becomes available to RNA polymerase when RsbW forms a complex with an additional regulatory protein (RsbV) and, because of this, fails to bind sigma B. Using Western blot (immunoblot) analyses, reporter gene fusion assays, and measurements of nucleotide pool sizes, we provide evidence for two independent processes that promote the binding of RsbW to RsbV. The first occurs during carbon limitation or entry into stationary phase. Activation of sigma B under these circumstances correlates with a drop in the intracellular levels of ATP and may be a direct consequence of ATP levels on RsbW's binding preference. The second activation process relies on the product of a third regulatory gene, rsbU. RsbU is dispensable for sigma B activation during carbon limitation or stationary phase but is needed for activation of sigma B in response to any of a number of different environmental insults (ethanol treatment, salt or acid shock, etc.). RsbU, or a process dependent on it, alters RsbW binding without regard for intracellular levels of ATP. In at least some instances, the effects of multiple inducing stimuli are additive. The data are consistent with RsbW being a regulator at which distinct signals from separate effectors can be integrated to modulate sigma B activity.},

Of particular importance is the growth rate, whose constancy represents a physiological steady state of an organism. Recent studies, however, suggest that the rate of elongation during exponential growth of bacterial cells decreases cumulatively with replicative age for both asymmetrically [11] and symmetrically [12, 13] dividing organisms, implying that a ``steady-state'' population consists of individual cells that are never in a steady state of growth. To resolve this seeming paradoxical observation, we studied the long-term growth and division patterns of Escherichia coli cells by employing a microfluidic device designed to follow steady-state growth and division of a large number of cells at a defined reproductive age. Our analysis of approximately 105 individual cells reveals a remarkable stability of growth whereby the mother cell inherits the same pole for hundreds of generations. We further show that death of E. coli is not purely stochastic but is the result of accumulating damages. We conclude that E. coli, unlike all other aging model systems studied to date, has a robust mechanism of growth that is decoupled from cell death.},

  abstract = {Nonequilibrium stochastic reaction networks are commonly found in both biological and nonbiological systems, but have remained hard to analyze because small differences in rate functions or topology can change the dynamics drastically. Here, we conjecture exact quantitative inequalities that relate the extent of fluctuations in connected components, for various network topologies. Specifically, we find that regardless of how two components affect each other's production rates, it is impossible to suppress fluctuations below the uncontrolled equivalents for both components: one must increase its fluctuations for the other to be suppressed. For systems in which components control each other in ringlike structures, it appears that fluctuations can only be suppressed in one component if all other components instead increase fluctuations, compared to the case without control. Even the general N-component system\textemdash with arbitrary connections and parameters\textemdash must have at least one component with increased fluctuations to reduce fluctuations in others. In connected reaction networks it thus appears impossible to reduce the statistical uncertainty in all components, regardless of the control mechanisms or energy dissipation.},

  abstract = {Cells use general stress response pathways to activate diverse target genes in response to a variety of stresses. However, general stress responses coexist with more specific pathways that are activated by individual stresses, provoking the fundamental question of whether and how cells control the generality or specificity of their response to a particular stress. Here we address this issue using quantitative time-lapse microscopy of the Bacillus subtilis environmental stress response, mediated by {$\sigma$}(B). We analyzed {$\sigma$}(B) activation in response to stresses such as salt and ethanol imposed at varying rates of increase. Dynamically, {$\sigma$}(B) responded to these stresses with a single adaptive activity pulse, whose amplitude depended on the rate at which the stress increased. This rate-responsive behavior can be understood from mathematical modeling of a key negative feedback loop in the underlying regulatory circuit. Using RNAseq we analyzed the effects of both rapid and gradual increases of ethanol and salt stress across the genome. Because of the rate responsiveness of {$\sigma$}(B) activation, salt and ethanol regulons overlap under rapid, but not gradual, increases in stress. Thus, the cell responds specifically to individual stresses that appear gradually, while using {$\sigma$}(B) to broaden the cellular response under more rapidly deteriorating conditions. Such dynamic control of specificity could be a critical function of other general stress response pathways.},

A fusion protein of a fast-maturing yellow fluorescent protein (YFP) and a membrane-targeting peptide was expressed under a repressed condition. The membrane-localized YFP can be detected with single-molecule sensitivity. We found that the protein molecules are produced in bursts, with each burst originating from a stochastically transcribed single messenger RNA molecule, and that protein copy numbers in the bursts follow a geometric distribution. The quantitative study of low-level gene expression demonstrates the potential of single-molecule experiments in elucidating the workings of fundamental biological processes in living cells. Visualization of individual proteins shows that translation of single messenger RNAs in E. coli yields random bursts of new protein molecules.

  abstract = {The general stress regulon of Bacillus subtilis is induced by activation of the sigma(B) transcription factor. sigma(B) activation occurs when one of two phosphatases responds to physical or nutritional stress to activate a positive sigma(B) regulator by dephosphorylation. The signal that triggers the nutritional stress phosphatase (RsbP) is unknown; however, RsbP activation occurs under culture conditions (glucose/phosphate starvation, azide or decoyinine treatment) that reduce the cell's levels of ATP and/or GTP. Variances in nucleotide levels in these instances may be coincidental rather than causal. RsbP carries a domain (PAS) that in some regulatory systems can respond directly to changes in electron transport, proton motive force, or redox potential, changes that typically precede shifts in high-energy nucleotide levels. The current work uses Bacillus subtilis with mutations in the oxidative phosphorylation and purine nucleotide biosynthetic pathways in conjunction with metabolic inhibitors to better define the inducing signal for RsbP activation. The data argue that a drop in ATP, rather than changes in GTP, proton motive force, or redox state, is the key to triggering sigma(B) activation.},
