# Title
**Modelling bacterial alternative sigma
factors and their competition**

# Short abstract
Bacteria have been reported to exploit the seemingly adverse
noise in gene expression to achieve biologically important
dynamical behaviours.
They can create phenotypic heterogeneity by stochastically turning on the expression of certain genes
which allow them to "hedge their bet" within a genetically homogenous population to
better survive a stressful environment.
Here we demonstrated that a variety of dynamical behaviours 
(e.g., stochastic pulsing, oscillation, and heterogenous expression) can be achieved by
a simple stochastic differential equation model based on molecular mechanisms.
The model further shows that the competition between
Sigma factors for the core RNA polymerase could give rise to the apparent cooperativity,
which is crucial to multiple biologically relevant behaviours.
